## Rendoki

Rendoki (Rand-o-Key) is a game where you are not in control of the controls. 

The goal is to solve various puzzles as the game's controls **switch** without warning. If the player doesn't react fast enough,
it's game over as the controls **snap** off, like keys being ripped off a keyboard. But just as keys can be broken, they can also
be **fixed**. Strange that the player can't choose what key they fix, but that's ok, ***right***?
